# travel-buddy

Travel Buddy allows users to drop markers on a Google Map of the locations they have visited within a specific country.  This allows the user to navigate to each location of their "Adventure" where they can write blogs/memories/journl entries, upload photos, and make reccommendations about their experience there.  Travel Buddy provides users the access to view other travellers Adventures to gain insight into the locations and help plan a trip of their own!  

This app is built using the following tech:  
✈ TypeScript / React  
✈ Node / Express  
✈ MySQL / Passport / Knex  
✈ AWS S3 / Multer / Google Maps API  

Feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions about the app!!  
It is very much still in production but hope to have an MVP in the coming months :)
